        <h1>Web Crawlers: What are they?...</h1>
        <p> A Web crawler is an Internet bot that systematically browses the World Wide Web, typically for the purpose of Web indexing. <br>
			A Web crawler may also be called a Web spider, an ant, an automatic indexer,or (in the FOAF software context) a Web scutter.<br>
            Web search engines and some other sites use Web crawling or spidering software to update their web content or indexes of others sites' web content.<br>
			Web crawlers can copy all the pages they visit for later processing by a search engine that indexes the downloaded pages so that users can <br>
			search them much more quickly.
			
            Crawlers can validate hyperlinks and HTML code. They can also be used for web scraping (see also data-driven programming).<br>
            
            A Web crawler starts with a list of URLs to visit, called the seeds. As the crawler visits these URLs, <br>
            it identifies all the hyperlinks in the page and adds them to the list of URLs to visit, called the crawl frontier. <br>
            URLs from the frontier are recursively visited according to a set of policies. <br>
            If the crawler is performing archiving of websites it copies and saves the information as it goes.</p>

        <h1>Java Part</h1>
        <p>We get a set of input URLs which act as a root or a starting point for our crawler. The links from these initial URLs are extracted<br>
			using a library called jsoup which is a HTML parser for java. These "crawled" URLs are added to a queue and each of these URLs <br>
			again act as a starting point for a crawler and the processes continues.
			<br><br>
			Since the Java crawler is multi-threaded, it can crawl at speeds of 10-30 URLs per sec. These URLs along with their title and <br>
			other infomation are added to a MySQL database as they are crawled because we need this data to build our search engine.
		</p>
		
		<h1>JSP/Servlet Part</h1>	
        <p>
			The frontend, i.e the JSPs and servlets retrieve data from the database of crawled URLs by getting keyword(s) from the user<br>
			as input. The servlet searches the database for relevant URLs and sends it to the JSP to display it on the webpage.<br>
